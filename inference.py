He wears a trendy oversized hoodie, tapered cargo pants, and high-top sneakers. He looks directly at the camera, maintaining steady eye contact as he speaks, his facial expressions showing subtle anticipation. The background features colorful street murals, graffiti art, and ambient city lights, highlighting the vibrant city atmosphere. The camera remains steady, capturing his bold street style and the dynamic urban environment..\nAssess whether the video is well-aligned with the textual prompt in terms of:\nSubject Existence: whether the subject described in the prompt appears and is accurate.\nObject Existence: whether the object described in the prompt appears and is accurate.\nSubject-Object Interaction: whether the interaction described in the prompt is correctly represented.\n\nProvide your reasoning, then output \"Yes\" or \"No\"."
